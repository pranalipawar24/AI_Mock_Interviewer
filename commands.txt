Here are the exact commands to upload multiple files to your GitHub repository from your local machine 👇
(Works for Windows CMD, PowerShell, or VS Code terminal)

✅ 1. Navigate to your project folder
cd path/to/your/project

Example:
cd F:\Projects\AI_Mock_Interviewer


✅ 2. Initialize Git (only once)
git init


✅ 3. Add your GitHub repo as remote
Copy the HTTPS link from your GitHub repo
(e.g., https://github.com/pranalipawar24/AI_Mock_Interviewer.git)
git remote add origin https://github.com/pranalipawar24/AI_Mock_Interviewer.git

If remote already exists:
git remote remove origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/pranalipawar24/AI_Mock_Interviewer.git


🔥 4. Add ALL FILES (multiple files at once)
git add .

or add selected files:
git add file1.py file2.py foldername/


📝 5. Commit the files
git commit -m "Added project files"


🚀 6. Push to GitHub
If it’s a new repo (empty GitHub repo):
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main

If repo already has commits:
git push origin main


🎉 You're Done!
Your multiple files will now be uploaded to GitHub.

If you want, I can also:
✔ Upload your entire Real-Time Competitor Tracker project
✔ Generate a README.md
✔ Set up .gitignore
✔ Create branches or GitHub actions
Just tell me!
